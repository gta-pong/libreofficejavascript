### About LibreOffice

LibreOffice is the free, libre, and open source personal productivity suite from The Document Foundation.
It runs on Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux. Support and documentation are free from our large, dedicated
community of users, contributors, and developers.
You too can get involved with volunteer work in many areas: development, quality assurance,
documentation, translation, user support, and more.
You can download the free Community release of LibreOffice from: https://libreoffice.org/download/

### For commercial use:

You are encouraged to work with a certified LibreOffice professional for your business needs, from
deployment or conversion from other office suites, staff training, or custom development needs.
