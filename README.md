# LibreOffice JavaScript Macros & Guides

LibreOffice JavaScript Macros & Guides

This repo was created for anyone looking to <br/>
a) Write LibreOffice macros in JavaScript<br/>
b) Download the LibreOffice PDF guides from a faster server

## Focus:

### JavaScript Version 1.7

JavaScript 1.7 builds on ECMAScript 3 (ES3) with several features that are also part of ECMAScript 5 (ES5). Unfortunately we can't write macros in the latest versions of JS / ES. 
LibreOffice ships with the Rhino engine (1.7R5; written in Java) to support JavaScript.

### UNO API
The Universal Network Objects (UNO) API is the core component framework used in LibreOffice. It allows JS to interact with LibreOffice components.

## Resources:

## Status:

Will be uploading some working JS macros soon!
