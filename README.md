# LibreOffice JavaScript Macros & Documentation

## The Problem

- Zero documentation for writing LibreOffice macros in JavaScript <br/>
- Zero code samples of macros in JavaScript <br/>
- Takes several hours to download the Guides from libreoffice.org

## The Solution

This repo was created for anyone looking to <br/>
a) Write LibreOffice macros in JavaScript<br/>
b) Find, read, and contribute to a knowledgebase on LibreOffice macros in JavaScript <br/>
c) Download the LibreOffice PDF guides from a faster server (Fastly - GitHub's CDN)

## Focus

### JavaScript Version 1.7

JavaScript 1.7 builds on ECMAScript 3 (ES3) with several features that are also part of ECMAScript 5 (ES5). Unfortunately we can't write macros in the latest versions of JS / ES. <br/>
LibreOffice ships with the Rhino engine (1.7R5; written in Java) to support JavaScript.

### UNO API

The Universal Network Objects (UNO) API is the core component framework used in LibreOffice. It allows JS to interact with LibreOffice components.
